The libms5803 project provides C library (with Python 3 bindings) for
various pressure sensors produced by Measurement Specialties

    http://www.meas-spec.com/pressure-sensors/board-level-pressure-sensors/digital-pressure-sensor-modules.aspx

The library was tested with MS5803-14BA pressure sensor

    http://www.meas-spec.com/downloads/MS5803-14BA.pdf

and on the following boards

- Raspberry Pi
- Acme Systems Arietta G25

The code of the library is licensed under GPLv3 license, see COPYING file
for details. As stated in the license, there is no warranty, so any joy
from destroying sensors or your boards belongs to you only.

Connecting MS5803 Sensor
========================
The MS5803 pressure sensor should be connected to a board via I2C
interface.

Using Library
=============
The interface is pretty straightforward, see examples directory.
